  <p>I’ve actually already coded this myself as a side-project some time ago, but I want to recreate the code again for this blog, while referencing my old code as little as possible. Unlike my last two posts, which used DrRacket, today’s post will be in Python 3, a language you guys are probably more familiar with. Enough with the introduction, let’s get started.</p>

  <br />
  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p>There’s been this one mistake I’ve made in the ongoing “Programming Snake” series of posts that’s been really bugging me. My current obstacle in programming Snake as of this post is adding segments to the snake and then coding it so that if the snake runs into itself, the game ends. My original plan in coding Snake was to work on it in sections, coding movement first for one single pixel and then adding the game-over mechanic for hitting a wall. However, while I think that breaking apart the game into sections and addressing sections individually is a good idea, I should have still prepared for the future sections. I didn’t start thinking about segments of the snake until after I finished coding the continuous motion of the snake, which I think will lead to issues with spaghetti code later on.</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/W4YG3aW.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>So for Hangman, I’d like to first outline all the different parts of Hangman and then individually address each section.</p>
  <p>Without further ado, here is the list of features I want for Hangman:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A main menu where I can change the difficulty of the game in settings.</li>
    <li>Have a preset amount of guesses that can be made before the game is over.</li>
    <li>Have a dictionary of possible words that can be selected for use.</li>
    <li>Have a set of underscores representing how many letters there are in a word.</li>
    <li>Replace underscores with the correct letters that are guessed.</li>
    <li>Have a list of already guessed letters and if a letter is guessed that has already been guessed, return a string notifying the player without taking away lives.</li>
    <li>If a player guesses a number, return a string notifying the player without taking away lives.</li>
    <li>A player will be allowed to attempt to guess the entire word at any point of the game, but if the length of the guess does not match the length of the answer, return a string notifying the player without taking away lives.</li>
    <li>The game ends if the player guesses the word, or if the number of guesses hits 0.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I think I’ve covered all my bases. I think working on the menu first will actually turn out pretty well here, mostly because the main menu will be rather simplistic.</p>
  <br />
  <h2>The Main Menu</h2>
  <p>The primary reason I want to create a main menu is so that the player will be able to set the difficulty for the game. This will simply change the number of incorrect guesses allotted to the player. There are three options I want in the menu: Start Game, Settings, and Exit.</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/YQDJgBQ.png?resize=345%2C307&amp;ssl=1" width="345" height="307" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/S05z3y6.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>So far, this code will only print out a string for the user, creating a main menu for the user to see. My idea for this is that the user will then type in either a 1, 2, or 3, which will then trigger the corresponding menu option. We’re definitely going to need conditionals for this.</p>
  <p>For the time being, let’s code for Exit. I would like for Exit to stop the program from running, and in order to do that, I’m going to set a loop for the main menu, and if the loop is broken, then the program would cancel.</p>
  <p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/QpfGdCa.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>I’ve created a variable called <em>Menu</em> with a value of true, and while <em>Menu</em> is true, the main menu loop will continue to run. I have to set&nbsp;<em>Menu</em> to true before the&nbsp;<em>while&nbsp;</em>loop so that the loop will run in the first place.&nbsp;Then, I made another variable within the loop called <em>menuChoice</em>, which will be equal to whatever the user inputs, as represented by the <em>input()</em> function. If the given input is equal to “3” (the data type that input() returns is always a string, so I have to put quotes around the 3), then <em>Menu</em> is set to false, which would then break the&nbsp;<em>while&nbsp;</em>loop, thus ending the program. Let’s set up the conditionals for Settings.</p>
  <p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/NkcY5oy.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>So, I’ve added another conditional stating that if&nbsp;<em>menuChoice</em> is equal to “2”, then print out the “Settings: …” dialogue and request user input again. <em>Difficulty</em> is set to equal the user input, and more conditionals are set. If&nbsp;<em>difficulty</em> is equal to “1”, then the program will set the amount of guesses (<em>amtGuesses</em>) to 9. If&nbsp;<em>difficulty&nbsp;</em>is equal to “2”, then it will set&nbsp;<em>amtGuesses</em> to 6, and if&nbsp;<em>difficulty</em> is equal to “3”, it will set&nbsp;<em>amtGuesses</em> to 3. I added two other conditionals, one to return to the main menu, and one that returns a notification if the given input is not one of the four menu options. If&nbsp;<em>difficulty&nbsp;</em>is set to “4”, then the program will&nbsp;<em>continue</em>, which means the current loop (the&nbsp;<em>while Menu == True</em> loop), is ended and it starts over from the top, effectively putting us back at the main menu.</p>
  <br />
  <p>You may have noticed that I set&nbsp;<em>amtGuesses</em> to equal 6 at the top, outside of the&nbsp;<em>while</em> loop. I did this so that if the user does not go into the settings to change the difficulty, the difficulty is set to normal by default. The reason why&nbsp;<em>amtGuesses</em> is set outside of the loop is that if it is set within the loop, the difficulty will always be set back to normal, even if the user tries to change it to hard or easy. The following diagram will help explain this further:</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/tmKvUe6.png?resize=715%2C360&amp;ssl=1" width="715" height="360" data-recalc-dims="1"><img class="center" src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/IRPr3Xg.png?resize=661%2C346&amp;ssl=1" width="661" height="346" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>The final menu setting, Start Game, will be where most of the code will be located. Selecting Start Game will simply run the actual code for Hangman.</p>
  <p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/0jCLjIJ.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>Before I talk about the conditional I created, I want to address&nbsp;<em>if</em>,&nbsp;<em>elif</em>, and<em> else</em>. Converted to English, when using an if-then statement, you are essentially saying “<em>if</em> this is true, <em>then</em> do this”. An <em>else</em> statement attached to the if-then statement is saying “<em>if&nbsp;</em>this is true,<em> then</em> do this, or <em>else</em>,&nbsp;do this”. But what is the point of&nbsp;<em>elif</em>? I had to look this one up out of curiosity. I didn’t see what&nbsp;<em>elif</em> brought to the table that&nbsp;<em>if</em> couldn’t bring.</p>
  <p>Fortunately, I live in an age where the internet has answers to just about every possible question. Googling the question brought me to Stack Overflow, and I got my answer. I think the first two responses&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9271712/difference-between-multiple-ifs-and-elifs-python" target="_blank">[Source]</a> help answer my question best, so I’ll try to re-explain it here:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The first distinction is that when you have multiple&nbsp;<em>if</em> statements in a row, the computer will check every&nbsp;<em>if</em> statement to check if it is true. So if I were to run a code like this:<br>
      <img src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/8u3Gqpj.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><br>
      Now, when I run the program, if I were to type in 15, it would return “This number is less than 21”, as expected. If I typed in 24, it would return “This number is greater than 18”, as expected. But what if I were to type 19? 19 is both less than 21 and greater than 18. With this code, it would return both statements, because both&nbsp;<em>if</em> conditionals return true. Now, let’s change the second&nbsp;<em>if&nbsp;</em>to an&nbsp;<em>elif</em>.<br>
      <img src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/zlaeHII.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><br>
      Now, if I type in 19, it only returns “This number is less than 21”. Why is that? If we refer back to what&nbsp;<em>elif</em> means, “else if”, we can see that&nbsp;<em>elif</em> will only be run assuming if the conditional above it is false. If the above is true, the computer won’t even bother trying the&nbsp;<em>elif</em> conditional.<br>
      <img class="center" src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/fi1Qrh6.png?resize=664%2C367&amp;ssl=1" width="664" height="367" data-recalc-dims="1"></li>
    <li>With that in mind, the second distinction is that&nbsp;<em>elif</em> helps save time and computation. If you have a set of conditionals that all start with&nbsp;<em>if</em>, the computer will check every single conditional, even if you want it to stop checking after one of the conditionals return true. So if we look back at our Start Menu, if the user inputs a “2”, then the computer shouldn’t even bother checking the Exit conditional because the input can’t be both “2” and “3”. If we left everything with&nbsp;<em>if&nbsp;</em>statements, then the computer would first check if the input is “1”, then check if it is “2”, and then check if it is “3”.&nbsp; That means that even if the user inputs a “1”, despite the fact that the first conditional would be satisfied and there would be no need to check the others, the computer would still check the other conditionals. This results in unnecessary computation. With&nbsp;<em>elif</em>, the moment one of the conditionals returns true, the computer stops checking the remaining conditionals. So with the code we have above, if the user inputs a “1”, the computer checks if the first conditional is satisfied, realizes it is satisfied, and stops checking the rest of them, thus shaving off that extra computation.<br>
      <img class="center" src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/bpFtpXT.png?resize=514%2C346&amp;ssl=1" width="514" height="346" data-recalc-dims="1"></li>
    <li>The final distinction is that&nbsp;<em>elif</em> allows you to tie in multiple conditionals to one <em>else</em>. If I followed five&nbsp;<em>if</em> statements with one&nbsp;<em>else</em> statement, the&nbsp;<em>else</em> statement would only apply to the fifth&nbsp;<em>if&nbsp;</em>statement. This can cause some issues, as highlighted in the following example (I’ll be using a slightly modified version of the example given by Stack Overflow user&nbsp;<em>user2333594</em>):<br>
      <img src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/12Y2VEM.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><br>
      With this current code, if a user were to input “12”, then the first conditional would hold true and “You are a child” would be printed. However, the second conditional would run false, and because the <em>else</em> statement only applies to the second conditional, the <em>else</em> statement would also run and “The age must be a positive integer” would also be printed (<em>Else</em> runs if the conditional(s) paired with it all run false). Now, if we run the program with the second&nbsp;<em>if</em> replaced with an&nbsp;<em>elif</em>,&nbsp; then the code should work the way we intended:<br>
      <img src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/wtDWTzq.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><br>
      Now,&nbsp;<em>else</em> only runs if&nbsp;<strong>both</strong> conditionals run false, essentially tying together multiple conditionals to the <em>else</em> statement.<br>
      <img class="center" src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/SMHd9zX.png?resize=334%2C353&amp;ssl=1" width="334" height="353" data-recalc-dims="1"></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now that we’ve discussed&nbsp;<em>if </em>and&nbsp;<em>elif</em>, let’s move on to the Start Menu conditional. As you can see,&nbsp;I’ve added the conditional so that if&nbsp;<em>menuChoice</em> is equal to “1”, then run the function&nbsp;<em>game_code</em>, which will take in two parameters,&nbsp;<em>dictionary</em> and <em>amtGuesses</em>. This way, whenever we change the difficulty through Settings, the amount of guesses that&nbsp;<em>game_code&nbsp;</em>will use as the maximum amount of incorrect guesses will also change. I also added a final <em>else </em>statement at the end in case the user inputs a number that is not one of the menu choices.&nbsp;Before we move on to programming&nbsp;<em>game_code</em>, let’s talk more about the first parameter,&nbsp;<em>dictionary.</em></p>
  <br />
  <h2>Creating a Dictionary (Reading .txt files)</h2>
  <p>I’d ideally like to simply import a text file of a bunch of words, have the Hangman code interpret that text file. and then create a list of possible words to use for the game. Otherwise, I’d have to type up all the words myself.</p>
  <p>For the time being, let’s get a text-file of known words, so that we can control our tests.</p>
  <p><img class="" src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/hsTKDs0.png?resize=794%2C495&amp;ssl=1" width="794" height="495" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>This should do. I’ll save it to the folder containing the code for Hangman as dictionary.txt.</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/11yYl27.png?resize=582%2C367&amp;ssl=1" width="582" height="367" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>Now we’ll want to open the file in our code, and then read the file, turning it into a list. So let’s do that.</p>
  <p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/GJ9ikWu.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>So the code above first opens our dictionary.txt file in read mode (when using <em>open()</em>, it defaults to using read mode if the code does not specify. To learn more about changing the mode, click <a href="http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/reading-and-writing-files-in-python" target="_blank">[here]</a>). We want to read each line of the file and then append the word to the list <em>dictionary</em>.&nbsp;However, we’ll also run into another issue. When python reads a line in a file, if it detects there is going to be another line, it will add “\n” (which represents a new line) to the end of the string.&nbsp;But we don’t want to have “\n” in our list, we just want the word. Let’s go over the code.</p>
  <p>This code simply states that&nbsp;<em>for&nbsp;</em>every&nbsp;<em>line</em> in&nbsp;<em>DictFile</em>:, append the line to&nbsp;<em>dictionary</em>&nbsp;after it has been&nbsp;<em>stripped&nbsp;</em>of the “\n” in its string. That solves our issue mentioned above. And that’s it. Pretty simple.</p>
  <p>When I first coded Hangman, I didn’t know about this method mentioned above <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" target="_blank">[Source]</a>, and I had done it another way. If you want to check that out, feel free to in the spoiler below. You should be able to see the big difference between what I used before and the new code above.</p>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible" onclick="toggleCollapsible(this)">Old Dictionary Creation Code</button>
  <div class="collapsiblecontent">
    <p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/zuXusMy.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
    <ol>
      <li>We first open the dictionary.txt file in read mode.</li>
      <li>An empty list called&nbsp;<em>dictionary</em> is created so that we will be able to append the extracted strings of words to it.</li>
      <li>We create a variable called <em>ReadLine</em>, which will represent the line that has been read. We then set <em>ReadLine</em> to equal the string “Dummy”, which will be explained in the next step.</li>
      <li>We would like for <em>readline()</em> to read every single line within the file, not just one. So we’ll create a&nbsp;<em>while</em> loop so that it will only stop appending <em>ReadLine</em> if it reads an empty line, or rather a string with a length of 0. For those wondering how&nbsp;<em>readline()</em> will move on to the next line with every iteration, it does so automatically. <em>readline()&nbsp;</em>simply reads until it detects a “\n”, remembers its place, and then reads to the next “\n”.&nbsp;<em>ReadLine</em> is set to equal “Dummy” outside of the&nbsp;<em>while</em> loop so that the loop can be started.</li>
      <li>Within that loop,&nbsp;<em>ReadLine</em> will be set to equal&nbsp;<em>DictFile.readline()</em>, the line that most recently was read. Then&nbsp;<em>ReadLine&nbsp;</em>is stripped of the “\n” string, and will contain only the word on that line.</li>
      <li>Finally, <em>ReadLine</em>, a string containing just the word on the current line, is appended to the list&nbsp;<em>dictionary</em>.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <br />
  <p>Now that we’ve gone over the parameters that&nbsp;<em>game_code</em> will take, we can start working on the code for the Hangman game itself.</p>
  <br />
  <h2>Making Hangman</h2>
  <p><img class="center" src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/RZFkHZ2.png?resize=526%2C322&amp;ssl=1" width="526" height="322" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>The first thing we want the game to do is pick a random word from the list&nbsp;<em>dictionary</em>. We can do this by picking a random number between 0 and the number of items in the list minus 1. We do this because the first item in a list has a position of 0, and the n<sup>th</sup> item in a list has a position of (n-1). So by picking a random number between 0 and (n-1), we essentially pick a random word. We can extract the item at position n in a list by doing list[n].</p>
  <p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/T23XRQ5.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>First, we have to import the&nbsp;<em>random</em> module, which is done on the first line of&nbsp;<em>game_code</em>‘s definition. Then, we set&nbsp;<em>word</em>, which represents the unknown word that the player has to guess, to equal an item of&nbsp;<em>dictionary</em> in the position randomly chosen using the <em>random.randint(0, len(dictionary) -1)</em> function. The whole thing is then set to lowercase letters using <em>.lower()</em>. We do this because a string containing a lowercase letter is different from a string containing the capitalized form of the same letter. I’d prefer to avoid a situation where the player guesses “a”, and the answer is deemed incorrect because the word actually contains “A”, not “a”. The illustration below will help better explain the code above:</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/UAWT3dl.png?resize=602%2C443&amp;ssl=1" width="602" height="443" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>Now let’s look back at our goals for this program, excluding what we’ve already accomplished:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Have a set of underscores representing how many letters there are in a word.</li>
    <li>Replace underscores with the correct letters that are guessed.</li>
    <li>Have a list of already guessed letters and if a letter is guessed that has already been guessed, return a string notifying the player without taking away lives.</li>
    <li>If a player guesses a number, return a string notifying the player without taking away lives.</li>
    <li>A player will be allowed to attempt to guess the entire word at any point of the game, but if the length of the guess does not match the length of the answer, return a string notifying the player without taking away lives.</li>
    <li>The game ends if the player guesses the word, or if the number of guesses hits 0.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The first goal should be our next step. We want there to be as many underscores as there are letters in the word, and we also want spaces between the underscores, otherwise we would have ____ instead of _ _ _ _.</p>
  <p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/hHsiwyI.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>First, we want to provide some sort of output directly telling the player how many letters are in the chosen word. We do this using the <em>print</em> function, which prints the length of the word,&nbsp;<em>len(word)</em>, converted&nbsp;into a string using&nbsp;<em>str()</em>. The remaining code creates the aforementioned underscores. A list named&nbsp;<em>underscores</em> is created, and the&nbsp;<em>for&nbsp;</em>loop below will add the underscores by adding a “_” to&nbsp;<em>underscores</em> for each letter in the word (<em>letter</em> is arbitrary here; what the <em>for</em> loop really does is go through a loop for each character in the string&nbsp;<em>word</em>). A separator is also created, which acts as a divider between each item in the list. Since we want a space to separate the underscores,&nbsp;<em>separator</em> is set to equal ” “, a string containing only a space. The underscores are then output to the user, using <em>print</em>. To combine the items in&nbsp;<em>underscores</em> into a string,&nbsp;<em>.join</em>(<em>underscores</em><em>)</em> is used, and by adding&nbsp;<em>separator</em> in front of that,&nbsp;<em>join</em> will add the given separator between each item being joined together.</p>
  <p>Some of you may be wondering why I bothered creating a separator when I could have just added “_ ” (with a space after the underscore) to the list instead of just adding “_”.&nbsp; This is because in the future, I would like to replace the underscores with correctly guessed letters. Let’s take the word FOE, for example. I guess the letter O. In the string FOE, O is in position 1 (0 is the starting position). In that case, I would like to replace&nbsp;<em>underscores[1]</em> with the letter O so that the underscore in the same position is replaced. However, the user would only input “O”, not “O ” with a space. If I were to simply replace&nbsp;<em>underscores[1]&nbsp;</em>with the user input, “O”, then the following underscore would be too close to the letter. To fix that, I would have to add a space to the user input myself each time, which would not be as efficient. Therefore, I add the separator from the very beginning so I don’t have to deal with that.</p>
  <p>Let’s try running this and see if it works! (I added a few&nbsp;<em>print</em> functions to print out the amount of guesses and the word chosen for testing purposes. Those will be removed afterwards.)</p>
  <p><img class="" src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/w6OYbzt.gif?resize=562%2C599&amp;ssl=1" width="562" height="599" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>Looks like it works! Time to move on to the other goals. We’ll want to do something that will process the guesses the player makes.</p>
  <p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/uJXCX1X.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>I created <em>ListOf_Guesses</em> for later, since&nbsp;I would like to have a list of already guessed letters displayed to the player, as stated in the 6th goal. First, I created a&nbsp;<em>while</em> loop that will continue to process guesses unless the amount of guesses remaining is less than or equal to 0, which would then simply end the game. A couple of&nbsp;<em>print</em> statements are made, simply for the player’s sake. The first one prints out&nbsp;<em>guesses</em>, which represents the number of guesses, and the other prints out&nbsp;<em>ListOf_Guesses</em>, which represents the guesses that have already been made. After this information is printed out for the player, the program then prompts the user for an input. Adding “Make a guess: ” inside the parentheses of input simply prints out that string before asking for the input.&nbsp;<em>Guess</em> is set to equal that input after it has been set to lowercase letters by&nbsp;<em>.lower()</em>. That way, when comparing user input to the word, all letters are lowercase, which makes it much easier to deal with. The next step is to set conditionals based on what the user inputs.</p>
  <p>There are five different possible conditionals for a user’s input:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The user inputs a string containing a number.</li>
    <li>The user inputs a string that is neither the length of the word or a single character.</li>
    <li>The user makes a guess that has already been made.</li>
    <li>The user attempts to guess the entire word.</li>
    <li>The user guesses a single letter that has not already been guessed.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><img class="center" src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/4nAnSzu.png?resize=630%2C339&amp;ssl=1" width="630" height="339" data-recalc-dims="1"><img class="" src="https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/QjLUPO9.png?resize=1255%2C504&amp;ssl=1" width="1255" height="504" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>With this, we’ve effectively translated those five conditionals into code. I also ended up moving&nbsp;<em>print(separator.join(underscores))</em> to within the loop because I wanted it to print it out after each user input.&nbsp;Let’s review the code:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The first conditional states that if the guess is not an alpha character, then print out a string telling the user to guess a letter.&nbsp;<em>Continue</em> tells the code to start over at the top of the loop without continuing to process the rest of the statements in the loop.</li>
    <li>The second conditional states that if the guess is both not the length of the word and is also not one character long, then the user will be notified with another printed statement.</li>
    <li>In order to create the third conditional, we have to set up a variable and some extra code. This variable is&nbsp;<em>alreadyGuessed</em>, which by default is set to false. The&nbsp;<em>for</em> loop below it essentially compares&nbsp;<em>guess</em> to each&nbsp;<em>w&nbsp;</em>(word) in <em>ListOf_Guess</em>. If&nbsp;<em>guess</em> is equal to&nbsp;<em>w</em> at any point, <em>alreadyGuessed</em> is set to true, and we <em>break&nbsp;</em>out of the <em>for</em> loop. The third conditional then follows: If&nbsp;<em>alreadyGuessed</em> is true, then inform the user that they have already guessed that letter and&nbsp;<em>continue</em>.</li>
    <li>The fourth conditional covers the case where the user attempts to guess the entire word. This can be detected by checking if the length of&nbsp;<em>guess</em> matches the length of&nbsp;<em>word</em>. If true, I am going to assume the user is attempting to guess the whole word.&nbsp;Within that conditional are two more conditionals. If&nbsp;<em>guess</em> is equal to&nbsp;<em>word</em>, then print out a statement informing the user of his victory (the code within the&nbsp;<em>print</em> statement is simply for grammatical purposes. If there is only one guess remaining, then don’t add an “es” to the end of “guess”, otherwise add the “es”).&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Break</em> stops the loop from running, which would return the user back to the main menu. If&nbsp;<em>guess&nbsp;</em>is not equal to <em>word</em>, then notify the user, subtract 2 guesses from&nbsp;<em>guess </em>(Attempting to guess the whole word should come with some sort of risk after all) and then&nbsp;<em>continue</em>.&nbsp;This must come after the third conditional because we want to check if the word has already been guessed before processing whether it is correct or not.</li>
    <li>Finally, the last conditional, an <em>else </em>statement, simply assumes that if the other conditionals are all false, then the user must have guessed a single character.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>As you may have noticed, the&nbsp;<em>else</em> statement simply appends&nbsp;<em>guess</em> to&nbsp;<em>ListOf_Guesses</em> and does not process whether or not the guess is correct or not. I didn’t want to do all the code in one step, so we’ll begin working on that now.</p>
  <p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/wbd6V0m.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>My plan for processing single character guesses was to compare the guess to each letter in the word, and then save the positions where the guess matched the letter. After the guess is appended to&nbsp;<em>ListOf_Guesses</em>, I created an empty list&nbsp;<em>positions</em>, where the positions in the word that contain the guess can be saved.</p>
  <p>I needed a way to extract the letters in the word so that I could compare them to the guess, so I decided to use an index. I used&nbsp;<em>word[n]</em> to find the letter in the n<sup>th</sup> position (0-based index) of the word. I would have to compare&nbsp;<em>guess</em> to the letter in the 0<sup>th</sup> position, then 1<sup>st</sup> position, all the way up to the n<sup>th</sup> position. I used the&nbsp;<em>range</em> function to do this.&nbsp;<em>Range&nbsp;</em>generates numbers starting from 0 and up to n, not including n. This works perfectly here because the last position in a word is equal to the length of the word minus one. The figure below explains a little better:<br>
  <img class="center" src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/Tyar9cd.png?resize=365%2C262&amp;ssl=1" width="365" height="262" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>Using a&nbsp;<em>for</em> loop, I can cycle from 0 to the number representing the last position in the word. Then, within the <em>for</em> loop, I created a conditional stating that if&nbsp;<em>guess&nbsp;</em>is equal to the letter in that position, then append the number representing that position to the list&nbsp;<em>positions</em>.</p>
  <p>After the positions have all been saved to the list, the following&nbsp;<em>if</em> conditionals help process that list. If the length of the list is greater than 0, then that means the letter was found in the word at least once. In that case, inform the user of how many times the letter was found in the word.</p>
  <p>One of our goals was to replace the blank underscores with letters that were correctly guessed. We can do this now by using a&nbsp;<em>for</em> loop that replaces each of the underscores with a position in&nbsp;<em>positions</em> with the correctly guessed letter. When we return to the top of the&nbsp;<em>while</em> loop, the newly edited&nbsp;<em>underscores</em> will be printed.&nbsp;You may notice that this conditional does not include a&nbsp;<em>break&nbsp;</em>or<em> continue</em>, so there is nothing to interfere with the original&nbsp;<em>while</em> loop. I will clarify the reason for this a little later on.</p>
  <p>The&nbsp;<em>else</em> statement refers to the case that&nbsp;<em>positions</em> is empty, or rather the length of the list is not greater than 0, meaning that the letter guessed by the user is not found in the word. In that case, inform the user that the letter is not found in the word, and then subtract 1 from&nbsp;<em>guesses</em>. Then&nbsp;<em>continue.</em></p>
  <p>The final&nbsp;<em>if</em> statement in the picture above is the win condition. If it detects that are no “_” left in&nbsp;<em>underscores</em>, then it can correctly assume that the entire word has been guessed. In that case, the user has won, so print out a string informing the user and then&nbsp;<em>break</em> out of the&nbsp;<em>while</em>&nbsp;loop (no need to continue the loop if the user has already won). I also printed&nbsp;<em>separator.join(underscores)</em> because I want the word to be reprinted if the player wins so that the player can see the whole word written out. Two paragraphs ago, I mentioned how I had chosen to omit&nbsp;<em>continue/break</em> from the conditional. This is because if the user guesses a correct letter, then I want the code to check if there&nbsp;are there any “_” left in <em>underscores</em> after replacing the corresponding underscore with a letter. If I left a <em>continue&nbsp;</em>within that&nbsp;<em>if&nbsp;</em>conditional, then it would not check if the win condition has been satisfied.</p>
  <p>Now we just have one more short section of code, the loss condition. The condition is simple: if the player runs out of guesses, then the player loses.</p>
  <p><img class="center" src="https://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/YzD3Jr1.png?resize=498%2C289&amp;ssl=1" width="498" height="289" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/PU3FcLv.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>This&nbsp;<em>if&nbsp;</em>condition has to be set outside the&nbsp;<em>while</em> loop because the&nbsp;<em>while</em> loop only runs when&nbsp;<em>guesses</em> is greater than 0. By putting it outside the&nbsp;<em>while</em> loop, then when&nbsp;<em>guesses</em> is less than or equal to 0, the&nbsp;<em>while</em> loop stops running and this <em>if </em>condition runs.</p>
  <br />
  <p>And that’s it for the code for Hangman! We’ve set up the main menu and finished the code for the game itself. Let’s try it out!</p>
  <p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/Rb1wOit.gif?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
  <p>Looks like it works! Let’s look back at our goals and see if we hit all of them:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>[<strong style="color: green">✓</strong>]&nbsp;A main menu where I can change the difficulty of the game in settings.</li>
    <li>[<strong style="color: green">✓</strong>]&nbsp;Have a preset amount of guesses that can be made before the game is over.</li>
    <li>[<strong style="color: green">✓</strong>]&nbsp;Have a dictionary of possible words that can be selected for use.</li>
    <li>[<strong style="color: green">✓</strong>]&nbsp;Have a set of underscores representing how many letters there are in a word.</li>
    <li>[<strong style="color: green">✓</strong>]&nbsp;Replace underscores with the correct letters that are guessed.</li>
    <li>[<strong style="color: green">✓</strong>]&nbsp;Have a list of already guessed letters and if a letter is guessed that has already been guessed, return a string notifying the player without taking away lives.</li>
    <li>[<strong style="color: green">✓</strong>]&nbsp;If a player guesses a number, return a string notifying the player without taking away lives.</li>
    <li>[<strong style="color: green">✓</strong>]&nbsp;A player will be allowed to attempt to guess the entire word at any point of the game, but if the length of the guess does not match the length of the answer, return a string notifying the player without taking away lives.</li>
    <li>[<strong style="color: green">✓</strong>]&nbsp;The game ends if the player guesses the word, or if the number of guesses hits 0.</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p>Alright, now I’d like to add one last thing before we wrap up this program. Our current dictionary only has four words, so let’s create a dictionary with a lot more. I’ve gone to a <a href="https://www.randomlists.com/random-words?qty=2000#" target="_blank">random list generator</a>, generated a list of 2000 words, and copy-pasted it into the dictionary.txt file. Alright, that should be it! If you want to try the code out yourself, you can check out the pastebin below! I’ve also included a link for the dictionary.txt file for you to download if you so wish.</p>
